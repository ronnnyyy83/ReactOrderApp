This project is created from create-react-app as a boiler-plate.
For this project I used scss as pre-processor for css and bootstrap for the styling.

I also used redux and redux-thunk for application state. All calls are made to my API server to avoid javacsript cross domain issue. All external call called in API project and forwarded as restAPI.

For testing I used Jest with Enzyme. I tested the most important components and not the containers.

### Use these command:
1. To Install Node Packages. - `npm install`
2. To Run Project - `npm start`
3. To Run Tests - `npm test`

### External APIs

2. jiraApi
